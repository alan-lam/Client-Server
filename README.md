# Client-Server

A simple client/server application using Java Sockets

Single is one server + one client. The server echoes whatever the client sends. Each is in its own terminal.

Multi is one server + multiple clients. Clients connect to the server and communicate with each other. Each is in its own terminal.

Simult is one server + multiple clients. The terminal running the server is also running a client. It's kinda simultaneously being a server and client. Additional clients run in their own terminal.
